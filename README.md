  Use of print in python :-
  
  print can be used to display integers,strings,arrays,etc in the output.

  syntax format for various data types :-
  
  To print string - print("CONTEXT").
  
  To print integer - print(Any integer).
  
  To print array - print([Any number, Any number, Any number,...]).

  We can a single print command to display various data types by declaring different data type as variables (such as a = "string", b = number, c = array) and using print(a,b,c).
