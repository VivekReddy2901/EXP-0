Aim : Basics of python

Theory :-

  Use of print in python :-
  
  print can be used to display integers,strings,arrays,etc in the output.

  syntax format for various data types :-
  
  To print string - print("CONTEXT").
  
  To print integer - print(Any integer).
  
  To print array - print([Any number, Any number, Any number,...]).

  We can a single print command to display various data types by declaring different data type as variables (such as a = "string", b = number, c = array) and using print(a,b,c).
  
  To display each data type on new line we can use print(a,b,c, sep="\n").  

Conclusion :-

  This Python program demonstrates different ways of displaying output using the print() function. It shows how strings, integers, and lists can be printed individually, and how multiple variables of different data types can be printed together using the sep parameter to format the output neatly. Overall, the program helps in understanding basic output operations and formatting in Python.
